# Text-Adventure
This is my first program in C++ so any criticism/advice would be much appreciated :) . To complete the game, you must fight all of the monsters in the dungeon. Each monster you kill will drop gold and random items, which you can use to make your character more powerful. There is a shop where you can buy and sell weapons and potions. Currently the weapon type available to buy depends on your profession, however the player's race is not significant at all in this current build. If I had more time I'd have probably added certain buffs depending on the players race (e.g. damage increase if and orc, increased healing from potions if elf etc.).
